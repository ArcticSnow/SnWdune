Credits:
This program is further detailed in a accompanying publication. The code is an
interpretation of a simulation algorithm first described in the following publication:

Werner, B.T., 1995. Eolian dunes: Computer simulations and attractor interpretation.
Geology 23, 1107-1110. DOI: 10.1130/0091-7613(1995)023<1107:EDCSAA>2.3.CO;2

If you are using this program for research, we would appreciate citation of
both papers.

Notes:
This program is written in C/C++ and has been compiled successfully with GCC 4.4.1 in
both Windows (XP, Vista, 7) and Linux (Ubuntu 11.04). We have used the following compiler
flags: -Wall -pedantic -O1. The program will function on some systems with higher optimization
but we have encountered problems in some cases with -O2 and -O3.

This program is designed to be called exclusively from a Python script as a long string
of arguments need to be passed to the executable. The idea being that the Python script
can easily be modified for batch operation, etc. Please contact Tom Barchyn for further
assistance if you wish to extend the program (tom.barchyn@uleth.ca).

Avalanche threshold is set as constant in this implementation

30 degrees is roughly equal to 0.57 cell width units. Thus, the
maximum permissible slope is set to 5 slabs, 6 slabs will
